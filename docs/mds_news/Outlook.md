  background-color: #f9f9f9;
  padding: 1em;
  margin: 1em 0;
  border-radius: 4px;
  box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);

">
  <strong>Example:</strong>
  
  _2025-07-22 Edition_
</div>  

- Drag and drop submissions into the appropriate weekly folder.

## Handling Repeat Submissions

- If a submission needs to be repeated in a future edition:
  - Add the item to the editorial calendar for the desired week.
  - Move a copy of the submission to that week's folder.

## Check for Updates

- Review all auto-responses carefully.
- Look for any updates or revisions that may be hidden within automatic replies.

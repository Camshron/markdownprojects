<br><br>

<fieldset style="
  border-left: 6px solid #673ab7;
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
  padding: 1em;
  margin: 1em auto;
  margin-left: 0;
  box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  border-radius: 4px;
  width: 90%;
  max-width: 600px;

  <legend style="
    font-weight: bold;

    padding: 0.4em 0.8em;

    Examples
  </legend>

  <h3>Dates</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>It is Sept. 4 or September 4, not September 4th or Sept. 4th.</li>
    <li>Preferably abbreviate the month if it's a full date: Sept. 4, 2024.</li>
    <li>Usually spell it out if not a full date: September 4.</li>
    <li>I make exceptions for this when I put dates in headlines, to keep headlines at a manageable length.</li>
    <li>If the date for something is in the same year you’re in (say, 2024), you don’t need to list the year.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Times</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>It is not 12 pm. It is Noon or noon.</li>
    <li>AP style says we should be doing it like this: 9 a.m. ET. But it seems that the standard here is 9 am ET—no periods—so just keep doing that.</li>
    <li>You don’t need to put zeros after a time, so use: 9 am ET instead of 9:00 am ET.</li>
    <li>On that note, be sure to note the time zone in everything. I’d prefer just to make it ET in all references.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Headlines</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Much to my chagrin, Strat Comm wants headlines in sentence case. So a headline would be:
      <blockquote>“Nick disagrees with Strat Comm team” not “Nick Disagrees with Strat Comm Team.”</blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>If you’re posting a blog on the website for MD Student News and it is a phase-specific item, put that in the headline so they know it’s an item for their attention:
      <strong>“Phase 3: Select Transitions 3 track today”</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <fieldset style="
    border-left: 4px solid #fbc02d;
    background-color: #ffffff;
    padding: 1em;
    box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
    border-radius: 4px;
    max-width: 340px;
    font-size: 0.95em;
    margin: 1em 0;
  ">
    <legend style="
      font-weight: bold;
      color: #000000;
      background-color: #fbc02d;
      padding: 0.3em 0.6em;
      border-radius: 3px;
    ">
      Exception
    </legend>
    Events for the calendar. Title case is fine for those, as they are the proper noun names of the events.
  </fieldset>

  <h3>Call to Action</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We get a lot of submissions that have no calls to action:
      <blockquote>“Phase 2 scheduling guidelines.” It doesn’t tell the reader what to do with it.</blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>It doesn’t seem like a big deal, but it really helps to make that explicit:
      <blockquote>“Class of 2027: Read more about upcoming Phase 2 scheduling guidelines.”</blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are some helpful lists online that you can print out that offer lots of call-to-action verbs.</p>

  <h3>Titles</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>As you know, we put the person’s academic credentials after their name on first reference:<br>
      Nick McLain, MD, PhD.
    </li>
    <li>On second reference (and third, fourth, etc.), just use their last name—even if they’re a doctor. Don’t put “Dr. McLain wrote this…” – just say “McLain wrote this…”
    </li>
    <li>When using someone's job title, capitalize it only when it appears before their name:
      <blockquote>Communications Specialist Nick McLain</blockquote>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Do not</strong> capitalize it when used <strong>after</strong> their name:
      <blockquote>Nick McLain, communications specialist, said that…</blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>
</fieldset>

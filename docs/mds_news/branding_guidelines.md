## Examples

### Dates

- It is Sept. 4 or September 4, not September 4th or Sept. 4th.
</br>
- Preferably abbreviate the month if it's a full date: Sept. 4, 2024.
</br>
- Usually spell it out if not a full date: September 4.
</br>
- I make exceptions for this when I put dates in headlines, to keep headlines at a manageable length.
</br>
- If the date for something is in the same year you’re in (say, 2024), you don’t need to list the year.

### Times

- It is not 12 pm. It is Noon or noon.
</br>
- AP style says we should be doing it like this: 9 a.m. ET. But it seems that the standard here is 9 am ET—no periods—so just keep doing that.
</br>
- You don’t need to put zeros after a time, so use: 9 am ET instead of 9:00 am ET.
</br>
- On that note, be sure to note the time zone in everything. I’d prefer just to make it ET in all references.

### Headlines

- Much to my chagrin, Strat Comm wants headlines in sentence case. So a headline would be:
</br>
- “Nick disagrees with Strat Comm team” not “Nick Disagrees with Strat Comm Team.”

  Events for the calendar. Title case is fine for those, as they are the proper noun names of the events.

  If you’re posting a blog on the website for MD Student News and it is a phase-specific item, go ahead and put that in the headline so they know it’s an item for their attention:  
    <strong>“Phase 3: Select Transitions 3 track today”</strong>
  </div>

### Call to Action

- We get a lot of submissions that have no calls to action:  
“Phase 2 scheduling guidelines.” It doesn’t tell the reader what to do with it.
</br>
- It doesn’t seem like a big deal, but it really helps to make that explicit:  
“Class of 2027: Read more about upcoming Phase 2 scheduling guidelines.”

There are some helpful lists online that you can print out that offer lots of call-to-action verbs.

### Titles

- As you know, we put the person’s academic credentials after their name on first reference:  
Nick McLain, MD, PhD.
</br>
- On second reference (and third, fourth, etc.), just use their last name—even if they’re a doctor. Don’t put “Dr. McLain wrote this…” – just say “McLain wrote this…”

When using someone’s job title:

<div style="
  border-left: 4px solid #673ab7;
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
  padding: 1em;
  margin-left: 2em;
  border-radius: 4px;
  box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  max-width: 400px
">
  <strong>Example:</strong>
  
  Communications Specialist Nick McLain
</div>

<ul>

<li><strong>Do not</strong> capitalize it when used <strong>after</strong> their name</li>  
</ul>
<div style="
  border-left: 4px solid #673ab7;
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
  padding: 1em;
  margin-left: 2em 0;
  border-radius: 4px;
  box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  max-width: 400px;
  max-height: 100px;
"> <strong>Example</strong><br>
  
   Nick McLain, communications specialist, said that…

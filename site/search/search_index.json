It is Noon or noon.</li> <li>AP style says we should be doing it like this: 9 a.m. ET. But it seems that the standard here is 9 am ET\u2014no periods\u2014so just keep doing that.</li> <li>You don\u2019t need to put zeros after a time, so use: 9 am ET instead of 9:00 am ET.</li> <li>On that note, be sure to note the time zone in everything. I\u2019d prefer just to make it ET in all references.</li> </ul> Headlines <ul> <li>Much to my chagrin, Strat Comm wants headlines in sentence case. So a headline would be:       \u201cNick disagrees with Strat Comm team\u201d not \u201cNick Disagrees with Strat Comm Team.\u201d </li> <li>If you\u2019re posting a blog on the website for MD Student News and it is a phase-specific item, put that in the headline so they know it\u2019s an item for their attention:       \u201cPhase 3: Select Transitions 3 track today\u201d </li> </ul>        Exception          Events for the calendar. Title case is fine for those, as they are the proper noun names of the events.    Call to Action <ul> <li>We get a lot of submissions that have no calls to action:       \u201cPhase 2 scheduling guidelines.\u201d It doesn\u2019t tell the reader what to do with it. </li> <li>It doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal, but it really helps to make that explicit:       \u201cClass of 2027: Read more about upcoming Phase 2 scheduling guidelines.\u201d </li> </ul> <p>There are some helpful lists online that you can print out that offer lots of call-to-action verbs.</p> Titles <ul> <li>As you know, we put the person\u2019s academic credentials after their name on first reference:       Nick McLain, MD, PhD.     </li> <li>On second reference (and third, fourth, etc.), just use their last name\u2014even if they\u2019re a doctor.
